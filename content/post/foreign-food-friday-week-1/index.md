A post about meal planning!  How exciting!  I’m kidding around… I am only posting about ONE night of the week… Foreign Food Friday (yes I’m all about alliteration when it comes to a themed meal plan night!).  I started this mainly because I was getting so insanely bored with the weekly meal planning and drudgery of grocery shopping.  Now we have shaken things up with Meat Monday (meatless wasn’t fun), Taco Tuesday, Whatever Wednesday (we need to eat quick because Wednesday is a busy evening), Tried and Tested Thursday, Foreign Food Friday, Seafood Saturday and Slow Cook Sunday.

Back to Foreign Food Friday though!  The idea is that we choose a country’s cuisine each week (from picking a piece of paper from a bowl so it’s totally random) and try it.  I am 4 weeks behind on posting about these so let’s begin with week 1.  China!

We were excited for China and thought it was a good intro to our new tradition because the boys had tried a few chinese food items before and were familiar with what they’d be eating on the Friday.

Our menu consisted of crispy shredded duck with pancakes and hoisin sauce, [honey sesame chicken](https://www.pressurecookingtoday.com/pressure-cooker-honey-sesame-chicken/) with boiled rice and salt chilli chips.  It went down a treat!  The boys both said it was a great meal and they were excited for this new tradition.

To add another dimension to Foreign Food Friday, we searched youtube for a ‘facts about China’ video and learned a LOT!  One of the most random facts being that the Great Wall of China was built using a mortar made of sticky rice!  Another is that half of the pigs on earth live in China!  Our least favourite fact concerned a delicacy known as virgin boy eggs.  Eggs, boiled in the urine of boys under the age of 10. A long standing tradition and it was supposed that urine had health benefits.  Shaking my head, they definitely weren’t on the menu!

After dinner and China facts we chose the slip of paper for the next week…

SOUTH AFRICA!
