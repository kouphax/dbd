When I was just a young lad...

> sentimental music starts playing, the mists of time surround us and we drift slowly into the past

When I was just a young lad, many years ago, my appendix ruptured and I had to get it removed.  Not exactly the most enjoyable experience in the world but it did leave me with a lot of time on my hands.  I was in hospital, off school, poison running through my veins and the fact a doctor had spent an hour or two rummaging around my insides not up to much physical activity. This meant there was a greater danger than my appendix - death by boredom.  At one point a friend of mine brought in their [Vectrex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex) (an old video games machine, it might have been steam powered or something I don't recall) for me to play but the promise of all day gaming was quickly dashed when the hospital didn't allow electronics to be used. Luckily this friend had a back up plan, actually come to think of it I never really appreciated how awesome this dude was... weird. Or maybe it was his mum making him do it... I do recall a certain reticence on his part handing over the Vectrex.  Either way - Thanks, wherever you are.  Instead of the gaming machine I was left with the backup plan of books.  Lots and lots of books.  So many books you'd think I was never leaving the hospital.  Among the books was a few of the [Fighting Fantasy](https://www.fightingfantasy.com/) adventure books.  These are the more involved Choose Your Own Adventure style book where you read a page, get presented with various actions, turn to the appropriate page based on the action you chose and quickly die at the hands of your terrible decisions.  Ultimately you are trying to get to the end without dying some horrific death which oddly applies to both these books and life in general.  There is a balance of story weaving, fantastic art and having your own agency (within the constraints the book set out) that adds extra depth to the experience and I lapped it up.

Why am I taking you on this little trip down memory lane? Well, it's because I need you to understand my mindset when I tell you how much fun [Escape the Dark Castle](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227456/escape-dark-castle) can be.


## The Premise

Simply put [Escape the Dark Castle](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227456/escape-dark-castle) is a Fighting Fantasy/Choose Your Own Adventure book in tabletop game form.  In it, you, and optionally a few companions wake up in the dungeons of a dark castle, nay not just any dark castle - *Thee* Dark Castle and using your wits, strength and cunning you must *all* make it out alive. To make matters worse you aren't wizards or warriors but normal folk with skills such as tanning or cooking - great for making a living but a bit useless when going up against a decaying 12 headed possessed chicken with razors for talons. You drag your little group through the story fighting off hideous beasts and nasty traps right up to the end where you must face down the final boss before escaping and going back to your restaurant or tannery to carry on with your life.  It must be a rather stressful experience and having suffered the childhood drama of having my appendix removed - I feel a sort of kinship with these poor people.

To boil it down your party of 1 to 4 players works its way through a series of encounters using dice to battle/avoid traps/steal/etc and *everyone* must be standing at the end to win the game.

## The Setup

Setting up is pretty easy.  Each player selects one of the 6 characters and gets the associated character dice.  This may sound simple enough - just pick the one that appeals to you the most - but there is something to consider.  Each character has their own strength and weaknesses - some characters are strong and a bit stupid while others are smart but not really great at combat and your party needs to find the balance of these as every ability will be put to the test and if you're not careful you will get your ass handed to you.

Ok so you've got your party - now you build the castle deck.  From the deck of 45 cards that come with the base game you pick 15 random cards, 1 random boss and the start card.  These get placed face down - start card on top, boss card on the bottom.  This random selection means that you will experience a different "story" on each play through.  There is an element of luck here.  Not all chapters involve combat or traps, some are food or a chance to steal some wicked items to help you and as such a good draw could mean you have more of the safer encounters but all in all we've found there to be a decent balance on most play throughs.

Finally, you place the chapter dice and item cards out ready for use during the game.

## Gameplay

You play the game by deciding who in the party is going to turn over the next chapter (this decision can be important as that person may have specific things applied to them), that person then takes the top chapter card reads it aloud, optionally, adding some theatrics to enhance the experience.  I'm serious about that though.  This game is all about creating atmosphere and telling a story it plays better when you go with it. It's like an RPG lite in that regard.  Once you've read the chapter card you'll invariably have some decisions to make - fight or run, buy or steal so on and so forth and all of these decisions are made as a team and the outcome decided by the dice.

### The Dice

The dice provides the mechanic by which outcomes are decided.  As previously mentioned each character has varying strength and weaknesses in the form of **Strength**, **Cunning** and **Wisdom**.  For example the Tailor has 4 cunning, 3 wisdom and only 1 might.  This means the tailors dice will have, wait for it, 4 cunning, 3 wisdom and only 1 might.  "But that’s 8, James, and the dice has only 6 sides".  You're correct.  Some of the sides of the dice have 2 icons representing a critical hit or double smartness.  These sides also have a shield which means the character blocks the current attack and takes no damage.

This brings me neatly onto how the dice are used in combat.  Read closely - this is the cool bit.  Let’s say you encounter a mean looking monster.  The bottom left of the card has icons representing the chapter dice you need to prepare.  Here is an example,

{{< figure src="combat.jpg" >}}


The eye represents cunning so you put out on chapter dice with cunning face up, the star - wisdom.  The icon with the person means you take 1 chapter dice for each player and roll them.  So, if we have 2 players we roll additional chapter 2 dice.  After that roll you'll have 4 chapter dice representing the "health" of the monster.  Then combat begins - in combat every player will roll their character dice and the results are used to remove the chapter dice you just setup from play.  So, if a character rolled a cunning - one of the cunning chapter dice would be removed from play.  If at the end of the roll there are any chapter dice remaining the monster deals damage (number on the bottom right of the chapter dice) to anyone who didn't roll a shield and you keep going until you or the monster is dead.  Of course, there are chapter dice that add additional elements and/or rules to the combat but that’s the basic gist.

I don't think just reading about this mechanic is enough to drive home how clever it is.  It's one of this deceptively simple mechanics that really ramps up the tension and draws you into the encounter that bit more.  Sure once again there is an element of luck involved - it is dice rolling after all - and a few *really* unlucky rolls can put you in a position were you know you won’t make it through the next 5 cards to fight the big bad but you got to just roll with the punches and enjoy it - you never know you might just make it. Never give up!

### Items

Like any good castle full of roaming beasts and darkness there is also treasure to be found.  Defeating monsters, bartering with lost sales people and finding chests all give your party an advantage.  There are weapons that allow you to increase your dice pool, spells that allow you change rolled dice and food that heals you.  Each person can only carry 2 things at a time (or one for two handed weapons) but there are opportunities to trade items to balance out the squad.

## The Art.... oh man... The Art

The art style in [Escape the Dark Castle](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227456/escape-dark-castle) is gloriously depressing.  Everything is proper old school fantasy art in black and white.  Every monster is hideous, every bit of life giving food is rotting and every encounter is dark, gloomy and foreboding. No one is happy, no one is having a good time, everyone just wants to go home and it is wonderful.  I've already said this game is about atmosphere and you get it in spades from this art.  You can just imagine how desperate the situations must be by just looking at a still picture.  Without this art this game would be just good - with the art it is something special.  Or maybe that’s the nostalgia talking?

## Final Thoughts

[Escape the Dark Castle](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227456/escape-dark-castle) does some things really well.  Not only does it ramp up the nostalgia and the atmosphere with the overall theme and art but it manages to introduce simple mechanics that are easy to play and limit any distractions that come with other more complicated mechanics keeping you right in the moment.  It's not a heavy weight game, you can bring it to the table and finish a game in 30 minutes, there is little setup involved and upskilling new players is a breeze.

If I had to make a criticism I'd say the luck factor may not be to everyone’s tastes - it can be frustrating if you're unlucky with the old dice but turnaround time for a new game means it's only a temporary set back and maybe next time, who knows, you'll claw your way out of that castle and get back to sewing some suits or whatever.  But also, luck aside, in my experience the game itself is probably going to kill you more times than you'll make it out.  It's a tough old game and knowing you've got to face your toughest challenge at the end really makes you cautious about rushing into battle.

Does it replay well?  In our experience, yes.  We've played a fair few games, usually one after another and we still keep bringing it to the table. We only have the base game but there are currently a few expansions packs on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1998318065/escape-the-dark-castle-the-legend-grows) right now that add new chapters, characters, bosses and tweaks to the mechanics of the game which will undoubtedly extend the experience as well.
