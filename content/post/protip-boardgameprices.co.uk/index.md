When I first started down the road of board game addiction I was buying almost all of my games from Amazon. There are very few brick and mortar stores that sell board games where I live and the ones that do generally stock a relatively small selection.

While Amazon is convenient - I can have my game on the table within 24/48 hours, less if I include the times I used Prime Now - it’s also typically more expensive than almost all retailers and you’re not really supporting the small business that exist out of a love for tabletop gaming more than making piles of cash.

But the problem comes when you want to move away from a monoculture - how do you know what sites exist; how do you know what’s the cheapest and how do you know which ones have any stock of the game you want?

Thankfully for European players there is a site that aims to solve all these problems for you: [boardgameprices.co.uk](https://boardgameprices.co.uk). The site may not be there prettiest store you'll browse today but its fast and functional. [boardgameprices.co.uk](https://boardgameprices.co.uk) allows you to search across hundreds of smaller sites across Europe for their game you are after and will show you what ones are there cheapest (including and excluding delivery), any promos on offer and whether the shop has any in stock? If your still not happy with the price you can also set up notifications for price drops so you can maybe snag a bargain later or add the game to your wish list. You can also import your wish list from [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) and make it a publicly shareable list if you want to help out your family at Christmas or Birthdays!

[Check it out](https://boardgameprices.co.uk) European players, it'll be worth your time.
