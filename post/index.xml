      <description>Survive: Escape from Atlantis is like playing Forbidden Island except you discover you&amp;rsquo;re playing Carcassonne but you&amp;rsquo;re playing it in reverse for some reason and someone decided to throw their copy of Get Bit into the mix.
Survive: Escape from Atlantis is nearly as old as me.
Survive: Escape from Atlanta is a not a Walking Dead themed version of this game but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me if it eventually became one - you know what these crazy brands are like.</description>
